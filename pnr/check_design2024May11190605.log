>>> The option values are suggested.

Warning: Cell contains tie connections which are not connected to real PG. (ZRT-511)
Warning: Ignore contact DIFFCON. (ZRT-015)
Cell Min-Routing-Layer = M1
Cell Max-Routing-Layer = M9
Turn off antenna since no rule is specified
Some excessive ZRT-661 warnings might be suppressed automatically.
To see all of them, please unsuppress ZRT-661 and set app option route.common.verbose_level larger than 0.
Warning: Ignore 2 top cell ports with no pins. (ZRT-027)
Info: number of net_type_blockage: 0 
Via on layer (VIA1) needs more than one tracks
Warning: Layer M1 pitch 0.320 may be too small: wire/via-down 0.315, wire/via-up 0.330. (ZRT-026)
Via on layer (VIA1) needs more than one tracks
Warning: Layer M2 pitch 0.320 may be too small: wire/via-down 0.360, wire/via-up 0.320. (ZRT-026)
When applicable Min-max layer allow_pin_connection mode will allow paths of length 7.50 outside the layer range.
