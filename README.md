Project Description:
I2C is a bi-directional serial bus that provides a simple and efficient method of data  exchange between devices.
It is most suitable for applications requiring occasional communication over a short  distance between many devices.
The I2C standard is a true multi-master bus including collision detection and  arbitration that prevents data corruption if two or more masters attempt to control  the bus simultaneously.
In this project, I will go through the ASIC flow to create the complete layout (GDS) of  an I2C which is a two-wire, Using SAED90_EDK.
